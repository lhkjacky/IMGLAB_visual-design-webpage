I want to update the handoff file.

STRICT RULES FOR HOW YOU MUST DO THIS — READ BEFORE TOUCHING ANYTHING:

1. READ THE FULL ORIGINAL FILE FIRST.
   Use the `view` tool with view_range to read the ENTIRE file from line 1 to the last line.
   If the file is large, make multiple view calls (e.g. lines 1-300, 301-600, etc.) until you have read every single line.
   Do NOT start editing until you have confirmed you have read the whole file.

2. USE ONLY str_replace EDITS — NEVER REWRITE THE FILE FROM SCRATCH.
   Every change must be a targeted str_replace on the existing file.
   You are ADDING and UPDATING content — never replacing the whole file.
   If you find yourself writing `create_file`, stop. That is wrong.

3. AFTER ALL EDITS, RUN A DIFF.
   Run: diff [original_file] [new_file]
   Verify that every line from the original is either preserved or intentionally changed.
   If any original section is missing, restore it immediately before proceeding.

4. VERIFY LINE COUNT.
   The new file must have MORE lines than the original (new content was added).
   If the new file has the same or fewer lines than the original, something was deleted — find it and restore it.

5. INCREMENT THE VERSION NUMBER.
   Rename the file to the next version (e.g. v1.2 → v1.3).
   Update the title line inside the file to match.

6. OUTPUT BOTH FILES.
   Present the updated handoff file AND update the README.md changelog with what changed and why.
